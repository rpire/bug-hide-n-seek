## Hello partner 🖐

This is just a little challenge I did when I was studying for the Micorverse Program admissions.

The function in the code is golf-result-giver, that means that depending on the parameters given to that function (strokes, par) you will have different results:

`1`	"Hole-in-one!"

`<= par - 2`	"Eagle"

`par - 1`	"Birdie"

`par`	"Par"

`par + 1`	"Bogey"

`par + 2`	"Double Bogey"

`>= par + 3`	"Go Home!"

Anyway... one of the test cases is `strokes = 1` and `par = 1`. It should return "Hole-in-one!", but it's returning "Par". Let's see if you can find the problem. 🤞
